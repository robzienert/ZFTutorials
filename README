h2. Zend_Form Decorators and Composite Elements

In this tutorial, I'm covering the how-to's on basic Zend_Form_Decorators and
also how to create composite form elements.

h3. Form Decorators

At the company I work at, the frontend guys prefer the flexibility they get when
each element in a form is wrapped in it's own dl tag. I've heard quite a few
arguments to both sides about semantics and this-and-that, but have come to the
conclusion that I'll do whatever makes life easiest on the team. So, with that
in mind, our goal is to get a form to use definition lists where each Element
is wrapped instead of entire Display Groups. Easy.

The first task is to setup your base Form class (in this case, Zfx_Form). All
application forms will extend this. It just sets up additional prefix paths,
defines a new default display group class and default form decorators.

h3. Date Select Composite Element

Composite Elements are Zend_Form Elements that are comprised of multiple
of multiple standard (or non-standard) Form Elements. The most handy of which,
in my experience, would be a DateSelect Element, which consists of three Select
Elements all rolled into one.

We'll need a couple things to make this possible: A Form Element and a View
Helper. The Form Element class is pretty straight forward, but the View Helper
can get a little crazy depending on how flexible you want to make it.
